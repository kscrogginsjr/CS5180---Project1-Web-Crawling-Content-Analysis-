Common name applied to large swimming crustaceans
"King prawn" redirects here. For other uses, see
Prawn (disambiguation)
.
The giant tiger prawn (
Penaeus monodon
) is an important species for aquaculture.
Prawn
is a
common name
for small aquatic
crustaceans
with an
exoskeleton
and ten legs (which is a member of the order
decapoda
), some of which can be eaten.
[1]
The term
prawn
[2]
is used particularly in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and
Commonwealth
nations, for large swimming crustaceans or
shrimp
, especially those with commercial significance in the
fishing industry
. Shrimp that are present in this category often belong to the suborder
Dendrobranchiata
. In North America, the term is used less frequently, typically for freshwater shrimp. The terms
shrimp
and
prawn
themselves lack scientific standing. Over the years, the way
shrimp
and
prawn
are used has changed, and these days the terms are almost interchangeable.

history

The terms
shrimp
and
prawn
are
common names
, not
scientific names
. They are
vernacular
or
colloquial
terms which lack the formal definition of
scientific terms
. They are not
taxa
, but are terms of convenience with little
circumscriptional
significance. There is no reason to avoid using the terms shrimp or prawn when convenient, but it is important not to confuse them with the names or relationships of actual taxa.
[2]
According to the crustacean taxonomist Tin-Yam Chan, "The terms
shrimp
and
prawn
have no definite reference to any known taxonomic groups. Although the term
shrimp
is sometimes applied to smaller species, while
prawn
is more often used for larger forms, there is no clear distinction between both terms and their usage is often confused or even reverse in different countries or regions."
[3]
Writing in 1980,
L. B. Holthuis
noted that the terms
prawn
and
shrimp
were used inconsistently "even within a single region", generalising that larger species fished commercially were generally called
shrimp
in the United States, and
prawns
in other English-speaking countries, although not without exceptions.
[4]
A
bigclaw river shrimp
. Prawns are sometimes said to be large shrimp or alternatively freshwater shrimp, but this large, freshwater creature is a
caridean shrimp
, and is rarely referred to as a prawn.
A lot of confusion surrounds the scope of the term
shrimp
. Part of the confusion originates with the association of smallness. That creates problems with shrimp-like species that are not small. The expression "jumbo shrimp" can be viewed as an oxymoron, a problem that doesn't exist with the commercial designation "jumbo prawns".
[5]
The term
shrimp
originated around the 14th century with the
Middle English
shrimpe
, akin to the
Middle Low German
schrempen
, and meaning to contract or wrinkle; and the
Old Norse
skorpna
, meaning to shrivel up, or
skreppa
, meaning a thin person.
[6]
[7]
It is not clear where the term
prawn
originated, but early forms of the word surfaced in England in the early 15th century as
prayne, praine
and
prane
.
[8]
[9]
[10]
According to the linguist
Anatoly Liberman
it is unclear how
shrimp
, in English, came to be associated with
small
. "No Germanic language associates the shrimp with its size... The same holds for Romance... it remains unclear in what circumstances the name was applied to the crustacean."
[11]
Taxonomic studies in Europe on shrimp and prawns were shaped by the
common shrimp
and the
common prawn
, both found in huge numbers along the European coastlines. The common shrimp,
Crangon crangon
was categorised in 1758 by
Carl Linnaeus
, and the common prawn was categorised in 1777 by
Thomas Pennant
. The common shrimp is a small burrowing species aligned with the notion of a shrimp as being something small, whereas the common prawn is much larger. The terms
true shrimp
or
true prawn
are sometimes used to mean what a particular person thinks is a shrimp or prawn.
[2]
This varies with the person using the terms. But such terms are not normally used in the scientific literature, because the terms
shrimp
and
prawn
themselves lack scientific standing. Over the years the way
shrimp
and
prawn
are used has changed, and nowadays the terms are almost interchangeable. Although from time to time some biologists declare that certain common names should be confined to specific taxa, the popular use of these names seems to continue unchanged.
[2]
[12]
Regional distinctions
[
edit
]
The terms
shrimp
and
prawn
originated in Britain. In the use of common names for species,
shrimp
is applied to smaller species, particularly species that are
dorsoventrally
depressed (wider than deep) with a shorter
rostrum
. It is the only term used for species in the family
Crangonidae
, such as the common shrimp or brown shrimp,
Crangon crangon
.
Prawn
is never applied to very small species. It is applied to most of the larger forms, particularly species that are
laterally
compressed (deeper than wide) and have a long rostrum. However, the terms are not used consistently. For example, some authors refer to
Pandalus montagui
as an Aesop shrimp while others refer to it as an Aesop prawn.
[2]
[4]
Commonwealth
countries, and Ireland, tend to follow British usage. Some exceptions occur in Australia where some authors refer to small species of
Palaemonidae
as
prawns
and call
Alpheidae
pistol shrimp
. Other Australian authors have given the name
banded coral shrimp
to the prawn-like
Stenopus hispidus
and listed "the
Processidae
and
Atyidae
as shrimps, the
Hippolytidae
,
Alpheidae
,
Pandalidae
and
Campylonotoidea
as prawns".
[4]
New Zealand broadly follows British usage. A rule of thumb given by some New Zealand authors states: "In common usage, shrimp are small, some three inches or less in length, taken for food by netting, usually from shallow water. Prawn are larger, up to twelve inches long, taken by trapping and trawling."
[13]
South Africa and the former British colonies in Asia also seem to generally follow British usage.
[4]
Shrimp
is the more general term throughout North America, particularly in the United States,
[4]
where it is the general term. In Canada, the terms are often used interchangeably as in New Zealand (larger species are 'prawn' and smaller are often 'shrimp.') but there are regional variations. In Western provinces, prawn is almost exclusively the general term. The term
prawn
is less commonly used in the United States, being applied mainly to larger shrimp and those living in fresh water.
