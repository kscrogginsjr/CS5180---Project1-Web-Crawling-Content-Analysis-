Equity and excellence in education are vital to California’s future, and central to teacher preparation at the California State University.
The CSU prepares more of California’s teachers, pre-school through grade 12, than all other institutions combined. Nearly eight percent of the nation’s teachers graduate from the CSU.
Our campuses work closely with local school systems to equip teachers to succeed on day one of their careers — with the skills and abilities to deliver high quality, culturally responsive instruction that helps all students learn and grow.​
