The Impact of the ​CSU
​​We​ are the
most affordable
public university system in the U.S., meeting Californians where they are—financially, socially and geographically.
We educate the majority of
California's teachers
and nearly 8 percent of the nation's teachers. In doing so, the CSU plays a crucial role in the education of every new generation.
We work to end California's "degree drought," supplying the state with
more career-ready candidates
than any other single source. Our three million alumni are employed in every field across the world.
We are among the
most diverse
university systems in the country, striving to be inclusive of students of all social, economic and educational backgrounds.
We drive the state's
economic growth
, supporting over 150,000 jobs and generating spending of more than $17 billion.​
